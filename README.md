### Guess the ApacheÂ® Logo
A simple function proof of concept application to guess the Apache project that goes with the logo presented.

You can find out more about the [Apache Software Foundation][5] and [Apache projects][6].

You can see the application [working][3] on github (via [RawGit][4]).

Code written in [Apache Royale][1] (previously called FlexJS) and Apache logos taken from [Apache website][2].

Some Apache projects missing, and/or some projects may not have exactly the right name (incorrect capitalisation for instance). Or a logo may be out of date. 
If your project is missing please add it to the [project.json][7] file and add it's logo to [resources/logos][8]. Another logo (without showing the name of the Apache Project) must be added to [resources/logos-blur][9].

Apache, the Apache feather logo and all Apache project logos are trademarks of [The Apache Software Foundation][10].
